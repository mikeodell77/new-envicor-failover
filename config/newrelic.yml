# Application Environments
# ------------------------------------------
# Environment specific settings are in this section.
# For Rails applications, RAILS_ENV is used to determine the environment
# For Java applications, pass -Dnewrelic.environment <environment> to set
# the environment

# NOTE if your application has other named environments, you should
# provide newrelic configuration settings for these environments here.

development:
  <<: *default_settings
  # Turn off communication to New Relic service in development mode (also 
  # 'enabled').
  # NOTE: for initial evaluation purposes, you may want to temporarily 
  # turn the agent on in development mode.
  monitor_mode: false

  # Rails Only - when running in Developer Mode, the New Relic Agent will 
  # present performance information on the last 100 transactions you have
  # executed since starting the mongrel.
  # NOTE: There is substantial overhead when running in developer mode.
  # Do not use for production or load testing.  
  developer_mode: true
  
  # Enable textmate links
  # textmate: true

test:
  <<: *default_settings
  # It almost never makes sense to turn on the agent when running
  # unit, functional or integration tests or the like.
  monitor_mode: false

# Turn on the agent in production for 24x7 monitoring.  NewRelic
# testing shows an average performance impact of < 5 ms per
# transaction, you you can leave this on all the time without
# incurring any user-visible performance degradation.
production:
  <<: *default_settings
  monitor_mode: true

# Many applications have a staging environment which behaves
# identically to production.  Support for that environment is provided
# here.  By default, the staging environment has the agent turned on.

  <<: *default_settings
